          <p>Vincent Chin was at a bar with friends celebrating his upcoming wedding when he got into a fight with
            Ronald
            Ebens and Michael Nitz, when Ebens implied that the unemployment in Detroit was due to people like Chin.
            Ebens
            and Nitz beat up Chin with a baseball bat, and Chin died four days later in Detroit. The Asian American
            community was outraged and shocked when Ebens and Nitz were sentenced 3 years of probation and $3,000 in
            fines,
            and formed the American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) to fight for justice. Through a federal civil rights
            investigation, the court convicted Ebens of being guilty of violating Chin's civil rights, and he was
            sentenced
            to 25 years in jail. However, Ebens appealed for retrial and won, so he never spent a full day in jail.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Chin was 27 years old. He worked as a draftsman and a waiter and was attending night school to learn
            computer operations. He was well-liked by his colleagues and supervisors, with a friendly nature and
            strong
            work ethic. His parents were both working class immigrants from China who worked in the laundry and
            restaurant industries in Detroit. He was adopted when he was 6 years old. His story, and the story of Lily
            Chin, resonated with many other Asian Americans as they realized his brutality could have happened to any
            other Asian American: a brother, a son, a relative, or friend. The outrage from the light sentencing and
            brutal murder prompted action and led into a strong movement. </p>

        <p class="small-img">Vincent Chin’s murder united Asian Americans in a way that never happened before. It
          created the first national
          pan-Asian coalitions for Asian American advocacy and included immigrants, elders, and everyone in between.
          It
          articulated Asian American systemic racism and helped kick off the Asian American movement, including a push
          for
          more national monitoring and reporting of racially motivated actions against Asian Americans. New Asian
          American
          advocacy groups began forming throughout the nation, speaking out and defying the model minority myth.
          Chin’s
          story also became a part of the victims’ rights movement to allow crime victims to make statements on the
          harm
          experienced as no witnesses were present at the first trial, and the protections against hate crimes were
          strengthened as the scope of civil rights in America was broadened.
