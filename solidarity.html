                <h2>Solidarity</h2>
                <p>To have the strength in numbers that is critical for movements, the ACJ built solidarity among many
                    different
                    groups. This allowed for a broader public sympathy towards Vincent Chin and more pressure on the
                    justice
                    system to help Chin.

                                <p class="info-text">The ACJ was the first national pan-Asian group advocating for Asian
                                    American
                                    rights. The ACJ was able
                                    to
                                    grow and expand among all Asian ethnicities though they started out mainly Chinese.
                                    Pre-existing
                                    national
                                    groups like the Japanese American Citizens League, Organization of Chinese
                                    Americans, and more
                                    supported
                                    the ACJ as well. The Japanese American community was critical in helping the ACJ due
                                    to their ongoing
                                    redress campaign for incarceration, and their relationship with current
                                    Congresspeople, like
                                    Congressperson Norman Mineta, helped the ACJ get federal attention in their cause,
                                    which has proven to
                                    be
                                    extremely effective throughout history. Additionally, the larger South Asian and
                                    Filipino population
                                    in
                                    Michigan was helpful for their connections with politics and helped highlight Asian
                                    Americans in the
                                    politics. This large outpouring of support from the whole Asian community, not just
                                    separated by
                                    nationality, was helpful in the fight for Asian American rights with the strength in
                                    larger numbers
                                    and
                                    similar experiences.

                            involved.
                            This was
                            different
                            from previous Asian American movements, like the Yellow Power and Ethnic Studies movements
                            that mainly
                            consisted of young students. Women also played a central role in the movement, with leaders
                            like Lily
                            Chin, Helen Zia, and Liza Chan. The ACJ was able to really connect people with Vincent’s
                            story as a
                            brother,son, or relative, and something that could happen to any Asian American, allowing an
                            outpouring of support
                            from all different cultural, class, and age backgrounds within the Asian American community.

                                    Vincent Chin as
                                    well. The Detroit Area Black Organization (DABO) was extremely critical in helping
                                    the ACJ get
                                    meetings with the judge and prosecutor of the case. Horace Sheffield, the leader of
                                    DABO at the time,
                                    became a very strong advocate for Vincent Chin and the ACJ, and he helped the ACJ
                                    meet with Judge
                                    Kaufman. Before Sheffield’s help, Judge Kaufman kept on delaying the meeting with
                                    Lily Chin and Liza
                                    Chan, writing that he was on vacation. Similarly, the Detroit NAACP branch spoke out
                                    in solidarity,
                                    protesting and speaking at the demonstration at Kennedy Square. Reverend Jesse
                                    Jackson also publicly
                                    supported the ACJ during his presidential campaign, further bringing national
                                    attention to the cause.
                                    Detroit-area Latinx, Arab, Indigenous, and women’s organizations, as well as
                                    religious communities,
                                    showed up in solidarity with the ACJ as well, further increasing numbers and
                                    pressure on the
                                    government for their legal action. This stronger and broader support for the ACJ was
                                    very beneficial
                                    to get national and federal attention and to increase their power in numbers.

                        <h4>Government Support</h4>
                        <p>Members of the Detroit City Council, including the president at the time, Congressperson
                            Norman Mineta,
                            and U.S. representative John Coyners all issued statements of support for the ACJ and the
                            cause for
                            justice for Vincent Chin. The ACJ was also able to meet with federal officials to start the
                            federal
                            investigation into Ebens and Nitz, which proved to be extremely important in United States v
                            Ebens to get
                            justice. The government’s actions were really important in turning the tide for this case,
                            for better or
                            worse, which has been shown throughout history.
