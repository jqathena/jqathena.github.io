                        <p class="info-text">Coalition building was a crucial part for the movement for justice for
                            Vincent Chin. It
                            allowed them to
                            have more power with more people. The first important step was creating the American
                            Citizens for Justice
                            (ACJ). This gave the movement a centralized organization to create decisions from and move
                            forward with a
                            unified strategy. Starting with the many Asian American community leaders, including those
                            from Detroit
                            Chinese Welfare Council, On Leong Merchants Association, Detroit Chinese Engineering
                            Association, Chinese
                            American Educational and Cultural Center, and womenâ€™s groups, church organizations, and
                            more. With the
                            formation of the ACJ, they intentionally chose the name to declare Asians as American and to
                            be broad
                            enough to create pan-Asian solidarity and further Asian American advocacy. The formation of
                            a centralized
                            organization allowed for a unified approach, further solidarity building, and more numbers
                            that were
                            important to gain more power. It was also the center to mobilize and organize supporters,
                            assembling
                            demonstrations and more to build a coordinated movement for justice. This united
                            organization was the
                            starting point for future steps to build the Asian American movement, starting with the case
                            around
                            Vincent Chin.
