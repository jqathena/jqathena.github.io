        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Vincent Chin was at a bar with friends celebrating his upcoming wedding when he got into a fight with Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz, when Ebens implied that the unemployment in Detroit was due to people like Chin. Ebens and Nitz beat up Chin with a baseball bat, and Chin died four days later in Detroit. The Asian American community was outraged and shocked when Ebens and Nitz were sentenced 3 years of probation and $3,000 in fines, and formed the American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) to fight for justice. Through a federal civil rights investigation, the court convicted Ebens of being guilty of violating Chin's civil rights, and he was sentenced to 25 years in jail. However, Ebens appealed for retrial and won, so he never spent a full day in jail.

        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p> Detroit was in a crisis and racially charged.The manufacturing sector in America, particularly the Midwest, was hit with economic disaster during the oil crises in the 1970s. The auto industry was hit particularly hard with the onset of popular international cars that were dependable, cheap, and fuel-efficient, especially with the higher gas prices from the oil crisis. Detroit, a city dependent on the auto industry, had an unemployment rate of over 17% as hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off. Soon, the Japanese became the scapegoat. Anything Japanese was a target: people smashed Japanese cars, owners were harassed, and politicians made racial comments towards Japanese people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, Detroit had a less than 1% population of Asian Americans, and the invisibility of Asian Americans was prevalent throughout the media. Asian Americans were seen as the “model minority”:  hard workers who didn’t interfere with society. Previous generations of Asian American activism in the Yellow Power and Ethnic Studies movements were all mainly students, and the term “Asian American” had not caught on yet.

      <h2>Legacy:</h2>
      <p>Vincent Chin’s murder united Asian Americans in a way that never happened before. It created the first national pan-Asian coalitions for Asian American advocacy and included immigrants, elders, and everyone in between. It articulated Asian American systemic racism and helped kick off the Asian American movement, including a push for more national monitoring and reporting of racially motivated actions against Asian Americans. New Asian American advocacy groups began forming throughout the nation, speaking out and defying the model minority myth. Chin’s story also became a part of the victims’ rights movement to allow crime victims to make statements on the harm experienced as no witnesses were present at the first trial, and the protections against hate crimes were strengthened as the scope of civil rights in America was broadened.
