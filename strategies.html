    <p class="subtitle-text">The ACJ used multiple strategies to get justice for Vincent Chin, from coalition building
      and solidarity to publicity and legal tactics. These allowed the ACJ to have a multi-pronged strategy to
      leverage different forms of power. Coalition building, solidarity, and use of publicity and media allowed the
      ACJ to gain larger numbers of supporters. Many Americans were not even aware of the injustice Chin faced, so the
      publicity and coalition building was critical for mobilizing and organizing support for the movement. Justice
      for Vincent Chin could be achieved by punishing his killers through the legal justice system. The three-pronged
      legal strategy allowed for multiple tactics to use to fight a difficult legal hurdle. Additionally, the
      publicity and large support from coalition building applied pressure on the federal and state legal systems,
      pushing for government help for Chin’s justice.

      <h2>Coalition Building</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        
        <div class="img-info right">
          <p>Coalition building was a crucial part for the movement for justice for Vincent Chin. It allowed them to
            have more power with more people. The first important step was creating the American Citizens for Justice
            (ACJ). This gave the movement a centralized organization to create decisions from and move forward with a
            unified strategy. Starting with the many Asian American community leaders, including those from Detroit
            Chinese Welfare Council, On Leong Merchants Association, Detroit Chinese Engineering Association, Chinese
            American Educational and Cultural Center, and women’s groups, church organizations, and more. With the
            formation of the ACJ, they intentionally chose the name to declare Asians as American and to be broad
            enough to create pan-Asian solidarity and further Asian American advocacy. The formation of a centralized
            organization allowed for a unified approach, further solidarity building, and more numbers that were
            important to gain more power. It was also the center to mobilize and organize supporters, assembling
            demonstrations and more to build a coordinated movement for justice. This united organization was the
            starting point for future steps to build the Asian American movement, starting with the case around
            Vincent Chin.

    <div id="solidarity" class="section">
      <h2>Solidarity</h2>
      <p>To have the strength in numbers that is critical for movements, the ACJ built solidarity among many different
        groups. This allowed for a broader public sympathy towards Vincent Chin and more pressure on the justice
        system to help Chin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Pan-Asian Solidarity</h4>
          <div class="flex">
            <div class="img-info right">
              <p>The ACJ was the first national pan-Asian group advocating for Asian American rights. The ACJ was able
                to
                grow and expand among all Asian ethnicities though they started out mainly Chinese. Pre-existing
                national
                groups like the Japanese American Citizens League, Organization of Chinese Americans, and more
                supported
                the ACJ as well. The Japanese American community was critical in helping the ACJ due to their ongoing
                redress campaign for incarceration, and their relationship with current Congresspeople, like
                Congressperson Norman Mineta, helped the ACJ get federal attention in their cause, which has proven to
                be
                extremely effective throughout history. Additionally, the larger South Asian and Filipino population
                in
                Michigan was helpful for their connections with politics and helped highlight Asian Americans in the
                politics. This large outpouring of support from the whole Asian community, not just separated by
                nationality, was helpful in the fight for Asian American rights with the strength in larger numbers
                and
                similar experiences.
              </p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="img-container">

                alt="Protestors, including women, people of all ages and races, hold signs for saying 'We have a prosecutor who won't prosecute.' and 'Justice for Vincent Chin'" />
              <p class="caption">Protestors of many different races, ethnicities, ages, and gender hold a picket line

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Additionally, the ACJ had many immigrants, middle-aged and elderly people involved. This was
                different
                from previous Asian American movements, like the Yellow Power and Ethnic Studies movements that mainly
                consisted of young students. Women also played a central role in the movement, with leaders like Lily
                Chin, Helen Zia, and Liza Chan. The ACJ was able to really connect people with Vincent’s story as a
                brother,son, or relative, and something that could happen to any Asian American, allowing an
                outpouring of support
                from all different cultural, class, and age backgrounds within the Asian American community.

          <h4>Cross-Racial Support</h4>

              <p class="caption">Rev. Jesse Jackson traveled to San
                Francisco Chinatown to speak out against racial violence towards Asians and

            </div>
            <div class="img-info">
              <p>The ACJ was able to build cross-racial solidarity in their cause for justice for Vincent Chin as
                well. The Detroit Area Black Organization (DABO) was extremely critical in helping the ACJ get
                meetings with the judge and prosecutor of the case. Horace Sheffield, the leader of DABO at the time,
                became a very strong advocate for Vincent Chin and the ACJ, and he helped the ACJ meet with Judge
                Kaufman. Before Sheffield’s help, Judge Kaufman kept on delaying the meeting with Lily Chin and Liza
                Chan,writing that he was on vacation. Similarly, the Detroit NAACP branch spoke out in solidarity,
                protesting and speaking at the demonstration at Kennedy Square. Reverend Jesse Jackson also publicly
                supported the ACJ during his presidential campaign, further bringing national attention to the cause.
                Detroit-area Latinx, Arab, Indigenous, and women’s organizations, as well as religious communities,
                showed up in solidarity with the ACJ as well, further increasing numbers and pressure on the
                government for their legal action. This stronger and broader support for the ACJ was very beneficial
                to get national and federal attention and to increase their power in numbers.

        <li>
          <h4>Government Support</h4>
          <p>Members of the Detroit City Council, including the president at the time, Congressperson Norman Mineta,
            and U.S. representative John Coyners all issued statements of support for the ACJ and the cause for
            justice for Vincent Chin. The ACJ was also able to meet with federal officials to start the federal
            investigation into Ebens and Nitz, which proved to be extremely important in United States v Ebens to get
            justice. The government’s actions were really important in turning the tide for this case, for better or
            worse, which has been shown throughout history.

    <div id="media" class="section">
      <h2>Media</h2>
      <div class="flex">
        <div class="img-info right">
          <p>The media was one of the most important parts of the strategy. It allowed the whole world to learn about
            the
            injustice of the justice system and applied pressure for the government to take action to correct the
            injustice. Headed by Helen Zia, the ACJ held its first news conference at the Detroit Press Club on April
            15,
            1983 and hand-delivered posters and flyers. It was novel for America to see Asian Americans in the media:
            America was used to the invisible Asian Americans who just worked hard. Breaking the model minority myth
            allowed more coverage as it was surprising and unusual. Local news covered the ACJ’s cause a lot. Liza
            Chan
            and Helen Zia appeared on a popular Black radio station, which allowed the ACJ to build cross-racial
            solidarity. Helen Zia met a New York Times reporter on vacation and told her the story about Vincent Chin;
            soon, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, and other national newspapers were reporting about their cause.
            Even international newspapers like Asahi-Japan were reportorting about the case.
          </p>
          <br />
           <br />
          <p>Lily Chin played a pivotal role in this. She motivated the group to speak out so that “no other mother
            must
            go through” a similar experience. She was a symbol of the injustice and a mother’s grief as she re-lived
            her
            pain on national TV, documentaries, and press conferences. She spoke with halting English and through
            tears,
            and her presence touched many Americans on this emotional level as a mother trying to live the American
            Dream,
            only dashed by her grief and the injustice he faced. Her life story before had resonated with many Asian
            Americans as hard-working immigrants, drawing more support to the cause. She helped build a community in
            the
            ACJ with compassion and taking care of the members, and many viewed her as an inspiring leader. She
            appeared
            on national TV, the popular Phil Donahue show, NBC First Camera, and addressed the Democratic Party’s
            Asian
            American Caucus, talking about her experiences to educate about Asian American racism.

      <br/>
<p>Many other publicized events, including demonstrations, runs, picnics, and debates, were extremely useful
            in
            making America aware of the injustice Asian Americans faced. Many did not know any Asian Americans
            themselves,
            much less see them on television, so the media was crucial in allowing Asian Americans to highlight their
            own
            experiences. It allowed for the ACJ to show the wrong-doing done, allowing for more sympathy towards their
            cause and larger national and international support for the movement, building pressure on the government
            to
            take action. Even if the legal approach was ultimately unsuccessful, Vincent Chin received a little
            justice in
            the media portrayal of Ebens and Nitz as his murderers. Documentaries like Who Killed Vincent Chin?
            interviewed Ebens and Nitz speaking and living freely in their homes. The contrast between their own
            freedom
            and the obvious fact that they killed Chin, especially highlighted in the title’s rhetorical question,
            further
            added onto the public outcry. This movement is forever remembered as a starting point for Asian American
            activism, and the media played a large role in that.

    <br/>

    <div id="legal" class="section">
      <h2>Legal Approach</h2>
      <div class="video">
        <div class="info">
          <p>The ACJ took 3 legal approaches to get justice for Vincent Chin. Because Ebens and Nitz’ sentences were
            already rendered, it was very difficult to get it overturned legally. The three-pronged approach allowed
            the ACJ more flexibility in case some were less successful than others. The legal approach would give the
            most direct direction to government action, especially as they found that the case was initially
            misrepresented through Liza Chan’s pro-bono work interviewing many witnesses. The police and court
            investigation had not interviewed the witnesses or notified them about the hearing, which left out key
            information in the case. Witness tapes like those shown on the right were crucial in the federal rights
            case and the appeal later on.
          </p>
          <p>The three approaches were:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Persuade Judge Kaufman to reconsider and vacate his sentence from State v Ronald Ebens and Michael
              Nitz. Liza Chan and Dan Hoekenga argued before Judge Kaufman to vacate his sentence, saying that the
              case was initially misrepresented as key witnesses were not notified of the hearing. The ACJ organized
              100 people to attend the hearing, but this approach was not successful.
            </li>
            <li>File a brief with Michigan’s Court of Appeals to overturn Kaufman’s sentence. Thomas Brennan, Liza
              Cheuk, and May Chan lead this endeavor, but it was difficult for this tactic to succeed.
            </li>
            <li>Seek a federal civil rights investigation with the US Department of Justice. This was ultimately the
              route that the ACJ would continue with as it was the most successful. The FBI began taking an interest
              in the case and started a federal right investigation, and United States v Ebens started. This was also
              influenced by the media pressure.
            </li>
          </ol>
