                            prove to be
                            critical in the decision for the federal case, with the lead juror saying that the dancers
                            at Fancy Pant's
                            witness in overhearing Eben's conversation with Chin was an important factor in their
                            decision. </p>

                    <div class="info">
                        <p>The ACJ took 3 legal approaches to get justice for Vincent Chin. Because Ebens and Nitz’
                            sentences were
                            already rendered, it was very difficult to get it overturned legally. The three-pronged
                            approach allowed
                            the ACJ more flexibility in case some were less successful than others. The legal approach
                            would give the
                            most direct direction to government action, especially as they found that the case was
                            initially
                            misrepresented through Liza Chan’s pro-bono work interviewing many witnesses. The police and
                            court
                            investigation had not interviewed the witnesses or notified them about the hearing, which
                            left out key
                            information in the case. Witness tapes like those shown on the right were crucial in the
                            federal rights
                            case and the appeal later on.
                        </p>
                        <p>The three approaches were:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Persuade Judge Kaufman to reconsider and vacate his sentence from State v Ronald Ebens
                                and Michael
                                Nitz. Liza Chan and Dan Hoekenga argued before Judge Kaufman to vacate his sentence,
                                saying that the
                                case was initially misrepresented as key witnesses were not notified of the hearing. The
                                ACJ organized
                                100 people to attend the hearing, but this approach was not successful.
                            </li>
                            <li>File a brief with Michigan’s Court of Appeals to overturn Kaufman’s sentence. Thomas
                                Brennan, Liza
                                Cheuk, and May Chan lead this endeavor, but it was difficult for this tactic to succeed.
                            </li>
                            <li>Seek a federal civil rights investigation with the US Department of Justice. This was
                                ultimately the
                                route that the ACJ would continue with as it was the most successful. The FBI began
                                taking an interest
                                in the case and started a federal right investigation, and United States v Ebens
                                started. This was also
                                influenced by the media pressure.
