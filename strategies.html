        <h2>Coalition Building</h2>
        <p>Coalition building was a crucial part for the movement for justice for Vincent Chin. It allowed them to have more power with more people. The first important step was creating the American Citizens for Justice (ACJ). This gave the movement a centralized organization to create decisions from and move forward with a unified strategy. Starting with the many Asian American community leaders, including those from Detroit Chinese Welfare Council, On Leong Merchants Association, Detroit Chinese Engineering Association, Chinese American Educational and Cultural Center, and women’s groups, church organizations, and more. With the formation of the ACJ, they intentionally chose the name to declare Asians as American and to be broad enough to create pan-Asian solidarity and further Asian American advocacy. The formation of a centralized organization allowed for a unified approach, further solidarity building, and more numbers that were important to gain more power. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Solidarity</h2>
        <p>To have the strength in numbers that is critical for movements, the ACJ built solidarity among many different groups. This allowed for a broader public sympathy towards Vincent Chin and more pressure on the justice system to help Chin. 
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Pan-Asian Solidarity</h4>
          <p>The ACJ was the first national pan-Asian group advocating for Asian American rights. The ACJ was able to grow and expand among all Asian ethnicities though they started out mainly Chinese. Pre-existing national groups like the Japanese American Citizens League, Organization of Chinese Americans, and more supported the ACJ as well. The Japanese American community was critical in helping the ACJ due to their ongoing redress campaign for incarceration, and their relationship with current Congresspeople, like Congressperson Norman Mineta, helped the ACJ get federal attention in their cause, which has proven to be extremely effective throughout history. Additionally, the larger South Asian and Filipino population in Michigan was helpful for their connections with politics and helped highlight Asian Americans in the politics. This large outpouring of support from the whole Asian community, not just separated by nationality, was helpful in the fight for Asian American rights with the strength in larger numbers and similar experiences. 
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, the ACJ had many immigrants, middle-aged and elderly people involved. This was different from previous Asian American movements, like the Yellow Power and Ethnic Studies movements that mainly consisted of young students. The ACJ was able to really connect people with Vincent’s story as a brother, son, or relative, and something that could happen to any Asian American, allowing an outpouring of support from all different cultural, class, and age backgrounds within the Asian American community.
          </li>
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>Cross-Racial Support</h4>
          <p>The ACJ was able to build cross-racial solidarity in their cause for justice for Vincent Chin as well. The Detroit Area Black Organization (DABO) was extremely critical in helping the ACJ get meetings with the judge and prosecutor of the case. Horace Sheffield, the leader of DABO at the time, became a very strong advocate for Vincent Chin and the ACJ, and he helped the ACJ meet with Judge Kaufman. Before Sheffield’s help, Judge Kaufman kept on delaying the meeting with Lily Chin and Liza Chan,writing that he was on vacation. Similarly, the Detroit NAACP branch spoke out in solidarity, protesting and speaking at the demonstration at Kennedy Square. Reverend Jesse Jackson also publicly supported the ACJ during his presidential campaign, further bringing national attention to the cause. Detroit-area Latinx, Arab, Indigenous, and women’s organizations, as well as religious communities, showed up in solidarity with the ACJ as well, further increasing numbers and pressure on the government for their legal action.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Government Support</h4>
          <p>Members of the Detroit City Council, including the president at the time, Congressperson Norman Mineta, and U.S. representative John Coyners all issued statements of support for the ACJ and the cause for justice for Vincent Chin. The ACJ was also able to meet with federal officials to start the federal investigation into Ebens and Nitz, which proved to be extremely important in United States v Ebens to get justice. The government’s actions were really important in turning the tide for this case, for better or worse, which has been shown throughout history. 

        </li>
        </p>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Media</h2>
        <p>The media was one of the most important parts of the strategy. It allowed the whole world to learn about the injustice of the justice system and applied pressure for the government to take action to correct the injustice. Headed by Helen Zia, the ACJ held its first news conference at the Detroit Press Club on April 15, 1983 and hand-delivered posters and flyers. It was novel for America to see Asian Americans in the media: America was used to the invisible Asian Americans who just worked hard. Breaking the model minority myth allowed more coverage as it was surprising and unusual. Local news covered the ACJ’s cause a lot. Liza Chan and Helen Zia appeared on a popular Black radio station, which allowed the ACJ to build cross-racial solidarity. Helen Zia met a New York Times reporter on vacation and told her the story about Vincent Chin; soon, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, and other national newspapers were reporting about their cause. Even international newspapers like Asahi-Japan were reportorting about the case. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Lily Chin played a pivotal role in this. She motivated the group to speak out so that “no other mother must go through” a similar experience. She was a symbol of the injustice and a mother’s grief as she re-lived her pain on national TV, documentaries, and press conferences. She spoke with halting English and through tears, and her presence touched many Americans on this emotional level as a mother trying to live the American Dream, only dashed by her grief and the injustice he faced. Her life story before had resonated with many Asian Americans as hard-working immigrants, drawing more support to the cause. She helped build a community in the ACJ with compassion and taking care of the members, and many viewed her as an inspiring leader. She appeared on national TV, the popular Phil Donahue show, NBC First Camera, and addressed the Democratic Party’s Asian American Caucus, talking about her experiences to educate about Asian American racism. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Many other publicized events, including demonstrations, runs, picnics, and debates, were extremely useful in making America aware of the injustice Asian Americans faced. Many did not know any Asian Americans themselves, much less see them on television, so the media was crucial in allowing Asian Americans to highlight their own experiences. It allowed for the ACJ to show the wrong-doing done, allowing for more sympathy towards their cause and national/international support to pressure the government to take action. 
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Legal Approach</h2>
        <p>The ACJ took 3 legal approaches to get justice for Vincent Chin. Because Ebens and Nitz’ sentences were already rendered, it was very difficult to get it overturned legally. The three-pronged approach allowed the ACJ more flexibility in case some were less successful than others.
        </p>
        <p>The three approaches were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Persuade Judge Kaufman to reconsider and vacate his sentence from State v Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz. Liza Chan and Dan Hoekenga argued before Judge Kaufman to vacate his sentence, saying that the case was initially misrepresented. Liza Chan interviewed many witnesses on a pro-bono basis as she found out that many were not properly interviewed during the police and court investigation, leaving out key information in the case. The ACJ organized 100 people to attend the hearing, but this approach was not successful. 
          </li>
          <li>File a brief with Michigan’s Court of Appeals to overturn Kaufman’s sentence. Thomas Brennan, Liza Cheuk, and May Chan lead this endeavor, but it was difficult.
          </li>
          <li>Seek a federal civil rights investigation with the US Department of Justice. This was ultimately the route that the ACJ would continue with as it was the most successful. The FBI began taking an interest in the case and started a federal right investigation, and United States v Ebens started. This was also influenced by the media pressure. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Like all movements, the ACJ faced many challenges in their movement. The media that had proved so useful to the ACJ earlier in starting the federal investigation also was the media that allowed Ronald Ebens to win his appeal on retrial. His main claims were that the trial failed in allowing him to change the venue, as Detroit had very prominent and intense coverage and publicity that was very scathing. Ebens argued that the jury was biased and had prior knowledge through the media.He also argued that the trial failed when excluding testimony on grounds of hearsay from Liza Chan’s interview tapes. The court agreed with Ebens, allowing for his appeal and retrial to become successful.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The topic of race was another challenge the ACJ faced. Many Asian Americans were unsure about speaking out against injustice, especially the immigrant, refugee, and elder communities. Many Asian Americans were raised with the model minority myth –- the idea that they should just keep their head down and work hard. However, they eventually decided that they were going to talk about race and advocate for Asian Americans. When they made this decision public, there was immediate backlash. There was sentiment that Asian Americans didn’t experience “real” racism or discrimination and no place when discussing race. Race was viewed as a black/white issue at the time, and people were unsure if the civil rights law even included Asian Americans. Even Ebens himself said that he didn’t know there was such a thing as an “Asian American plight.” This made it more challenging for the ACJ to prove that Chin’s murder was racially motivated and that his civil rights were violated if people did not believe that Asian Americans could be discriminated against or were included in the civil rights laws. Similarly, there was sentiment that Asians were trying to “ride the coattails” of Black people and their movements, while pointing out that many Asians themselves have anti-Black prejudice. The ACJ was built upon previous Asian movements like Yellow Power, which was heavily influenced by the Black Power movement, and the ACJ acknowledged their influence from Black civil rights movements. Additionally, the ACJ tried to educate Asian Americans about the civil rights movements and committed to supporting Black communities to build solidarity.  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Though coalition building was central and important in the ACJ’s success in building national and federal support, it proved very challenging. There was fighting within the organization as people of different class, language, culture, and political backgrounds came together. To help prevent this, the ACJ prohibited talking about international affairs and refused international aid to keep building solidarity among otherwise polarized groups, including the fervent nationalists and communist supporters. Despite these efforts, conflicts still occurred, like the highly publicized event in San Francisco Chinatown's Cameron House, where the local rival political factions tried elbowing each other off stage.
