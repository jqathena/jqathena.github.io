                            Public
                            appearances and discussions like this allowed the ACJ to highlight their movement to a

                        <p>The media was one of the most important parts of the strategy. It allowed the whole world to
                            learn about
                            the
                            injustice of the justice system and applied pressure for the government to take action to
                            correct the
                            injustice. Headed by Helen Zia, the ACJ held its first news conference at the Detroit Press
                            Club on April
                            15,
                            1983 and hand-delivered posters and flyers. It was novel for America to see Asian Americans
                            in the media:
                            America was used to the invisible Asian Americans who just worked hard. Breaking the model
                            minority myth
                            allowed more coverage as it was surprising and unusual. Local news covered the ACJ’s cause a
                            lot. Liza
                            Chan
                            and Helen Zia appeared on a popular Black radio station, which allowed the ACJ to build
                            cross-racial
                            solidarity. Helen Zia met a New York Times reporter on vacation and told her the story about
                            Vincent Chin;
                            soon, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, and other national newspapers were reporting
                            about their cause.
                            Even international newspapers like Asahi-Japan were reportorting about the case.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>Lily Chin played a pivotal role in this. She motivated the group to speak out so that “no
                            other mother
                            must
                            go through” a similar experience. She was a symbol of the injustice and a mother’s grief as
                            she re-lived
                            her
                            pain on national TV, documentaries, and press conferences. She spoke with halting English
                            and through
                            tears,
                            and her presence touched many Americans on this emotional level as a mother trying to live
                            the American
                            Dream,
                            only dashed by her grief and the injustice he faced. Her life story before had resonated
                            with many Asian
                            Americans as hard-working immigrants, drawing more support to the cause. She helped build a
                            community in
                            the
                            ACJ with compassion and taking care of the members, and many viewed her as an inspiring
                            leader. She
                            appeared
                            on national TV, the popular Phil Donahue show, NBC First Camera, and addressed the
                            Democratic Party’s
                            Asian
                            American Caucus, talking about her experiences to educate about Asian American racism.

                            <p class="small-img right" >Many other publicized events, including demonstrations, runs, picnics, and debates, were
                                extremely useful
                                in
                                making America aware of the injustice Asian Americans faced. Many did not know any Asian
                                Americans
                                themselves,
                                much less see them on television, so the media was crucial in allowing Asian Americans
                                to highlight their
                                own
                                experiences. It allowed for the ACJ to show the wrong-doing done, allowing for more
                                sympathy towards their
                                cause and larger national and international support for the movement, building pressure
                                on the government
                                to
                                take action. Even if the legal approach was ultimately unsuccessful, Vincent Chin
                                received a little
                                justice in
                                the media portrayal of Ebens and Nitz as his murderers. Documentaries like Who Killed
                                Vincent Chin?
                                interviewed Ebens and Nitz speaking and living freely in their homes. The contrast
                                between their own
                                freedom
                                and the obvious fact that they killed Chin, especially highlighted in the title’s
                                rhetorical question,
                                further
                                added onto the public outcry. This movement is forever remembered as a starting point
                                for Asian American
                                activism, and the media played a large role in that.
