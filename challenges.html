        Like all movements, the ACJ faced many challenges in their movement. The media that had proved so useful to the
        ACJ earlier in starting the federal investigation also was the media that allowed Ronald Ebens to win his appeal
        on retrial. His main claims were that the trial failed in allowing him to change the venue, as Detroit had very
        prominent and intense coverage and publicity that was very scathing. Ebens argued that the jury was biased and
        had prior knowledge through the media.He also argued that the trial failed when excluding testimony on grounds
        of hearsay from Liza Chan’s interview tapes. The court agreed with Ebens, allowing for his appeal and retrial to
        become successful.

      <p>The topic of race was another challenge the ACJ faced. Many Asian Americans were unsure about speaking out
        against injustice, especially the immigrant, refugee, and elder communities. Many Asian Americans were raised
        with the model minority myth –- the idea that they should just keep their head down and work hard. However, they
        eventually decided that they were going to talk about race and advocate for Asian Americans. When they made this
        decision public, there was immediate backlash. There was sentiment that Asian Americans didn’t experience “real”
        racism or discrimination and no place when discussing race. Race was viewed as a black/white issue at the time,
        and people were unsure if the civil rights law even included Asian Americans. Even Ebens himself said that he
        didn’t know there was such a thing as an “Asian American plight,” even though anti-Japanese sentiment was
        clearly evident during the WWII incarceration and the targeting of Japanese cars and people. This made it more
        challenging for the ACJ to prove that Chin’s murder was racially motivated and that his civil rights were
        violated if people did not believe that Asian Americans could be discriminated against or were included in the
        civil rights laws. Similarly, there was sentiment that Asians were trying to “ride the coattails” of Black
        people and their movements, while pointing out that many Asians themselves have anti-Black prejudice. The ACJ
        was built upon previous Asian American movements like Yellow Power, which was heavily influenced by the Black
        Power
        movement, and the ACJ acknowledged their influence from Black civil rights movements. Previous civil rights
        movements helpd inform the nonviolent strategies the ACJ used, and the student activism that helped coin the
        term 'Asian American' was also important in laying the foundations for this movement. Additionally, the ACJ
        tried to educate Asian Americans about the civil rights movements and committed to supporting Black communities
        to build solidarity.

      <p>Though coalition building was central and important in the ACJ’s success in building national and federal
        support, it proved very challenging. There was fighting within the organization as people of different class,
        language, culture, and political backgrounds came together. To help prevent this, the ACJ prohibited talking
        about international affairs and refused international aid to keep building solidarity among otherwise polarized
        groups, including the fervent nationalists and communist supporters. Despite these efforts, conflicts still
        occurred, like the highly publicized event in San Francisco Chinatown's Cameron House, where the local rival
        political factions tried elbowing each other off stage.
